            A paragraph is a series of sentences on a specific point or topic. 
            A well written paragraph must have a topic sentence which states the
            main idea: what the paragraph is about.  While some say the  topic 
            sentence can be anywhere in the paragraph, it is best to put it as the 
            first sentence in a paragraph.  The rest of the sentences in the paragraph 
            support, elaborate, and/or further explain the main idea expressed in the topic sentence.
